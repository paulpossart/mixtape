 ## About
 This SPA project uses the Spotify Web API to fetch user profile data, search for songs, and save a new playlist to a user's account. I made it to practise API calls and user authentication.  
 
 Mixtape is built using React, Redux Toolkit, and SCSS.  
 
 Figma prototype: https://www.figma.com/design/8GNRvuZfj11OSnSM9vvWe3/mixtape?node-id=0-1&t=tiu0QqEOSPnuipns-1
 ## Try it out!
 To test search functionality, try searching for 'Foxey Lady'. A *name* search will return the Jimi Hendrix song. An *artist* search will return empty. An *album* search will return various artists.
 ## Issues
 The app originally used Spotify API's preview_url property to allow users to play a preview of a song. 
 That property is now deprecated, so the project uses an embedded Spotify mini-player to allow users to play tracks. 
 While users can still listen to songs, the mini-player allows for less control over the functionality and appearance of the app.
 ## Next-steps
 * ~Upgrade authentication to PKCE flow~ Done!
 * ~Refactor for greater modularity - some of the components got out of control during the later stages of the project!~ Done!
 * Implement a test suite with Jest
   * Added unit and integration tests for key API endpoints: user login, song retrieval, and saving to Spotify
 * Get approved for publication by Spotify for general use
